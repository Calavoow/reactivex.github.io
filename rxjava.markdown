RxJava is a Java VM implementation of <a href="https://rx.codeplex.com">Reactive Extensions</a>: a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.

It extends the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">observer pattern</a> to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O.
